Project Overview
This project is an interactive Sales Analytics Dashboard built to help users easily explore and understand key business performance trends. The dashboard brings together sales data from different sources and presents it in a clear, visual, and easy-to-interpret format. It is designed for anyone who wants a quick overview of how a business is performing across products, regions, customer segments, and time.

The purpose of this dashboard is to turn raw sales numbers into meaningful insights.
Instead of reading long spreadsheets, users can instantly see:

-How much the company sold
-Where the sales are coming from
-Which products perform the best
-How customer groups contribute to revenue
-How sales change over time

The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter and explore the data based on their needs.


Key Features

1. Total Sales & Total Units Sold
These cards at the top of the dashboard give a quick snapshot of overall performance. They show:
-Total revenue generated
-Total number of items sold
This helps users understand the overall scale of the business at a glance.
2. Sales by Country
A map visual shows where sales are coming from geographically.
This helps identify:
- High-performing regions
-Markets with growth potential
-Areas where sales are low or steady
3. Product Category Performance
A line chart displays how different product categories are performing.
It clearly shows:
-Best-selling categories

This makes it easy to identify what drives most of the revenue and which products may need more attention.
5. Sales Trends Over Time
A monthly line chart shows how sales change across 2024 and 2025.
This helps users spot:
-Seasonal patterns
-Growth or decline over time

6. Customer Segment Analysis
A pie chart and bar chart show how different customer segments contribute to overall sales.
This helps answer important questions such as:
-Which customer groups buy the most?

7. Sales by Gender
A simple donut chart shows sales amounts by gender groups.
This gives insight into buying behavior and demographics.

The dashboard also highlights clear monthly trends. In both 2024 and 2025, sales show noticeable fluctuations throughout the year, with peaks during mid-year months and dips toward the end of the year. This helps identify seasonal patterns and potential promotion opportunities.
Product-level insights show that Product_8 is the top-selling item with 199 units sold, followed closely by Product_19 and Product_5. This helps identify high-performing items and stock priorities.
